AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a cloud computing platform that offers infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS) service. AWS services provide scalable computing, storage, databases, analytics, and other services. AWS helps businesses grow up by providing database storage, computational capacity, content distribution, and networking, among other services. It allows you to pick and choose your desired solutions while only paying for the services you use. AWS is cost-effective, which means it lets you save money while delivering more value without sacrificing application speed or user experience.
